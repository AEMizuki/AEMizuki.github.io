        <h2>Culture Of Vocaloid</h2>
        <article>
            <h3>How did Vocaloid Music come about?</h3> <!--First Part Of Culture Subtopic-->
            <div>
                <p>The first vocaloid software was created in 2004 named "VOCALOID1", developed by Yamaha Corporation
                </p>
                <img src="images/vocaloid1software_image.png" height="315" alt="vocaloid1"
                    title="firstgenerationvocaloidsoftware">
                <p>The synthesizer(VOCALOID1) was used to let users input melodies and lyrics to create songs using
                    virtual voices</p>
                <p>There were 3 main voicebanks introduced at this time:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Leon and Lola (English)</li>
                    <li>Miriam (based on a singer)</li>
                </ol>
                <p>At this time, vocaloid was still rather unpopular due to robotic vocals and no engaging design of
                    characters</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <p>A sudden burst in popularity for vocaloid came about in 2007 with the introduction of Hatsune Miku
                    using a new engine named "VOCALOID2"</p>
                <img src="images/vocaloid2software_image.png" height="315" alt="vocaloid2"
                    title="secondgenerationvocaloidsoftware">
                <img src="images/2007miku_image.png" height="315" alt="miku" title="mikufromyear2007">
                <p>Miku was designed in an anime-style with a story and an identity which gave users not just a software
                    but an idol that they could build stories and songs around</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <p>A Japanese platform called Nico Nico Douga allowed creators to upload and share their original song
                    productions</p>
                <img src="images/niconicodouga_image.png" height="315" alt="platform" title="vocaloidproducersplatform">
                <p>Over time, viral hits began to pop up, such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Melt (by ryo) <button id="video1">Official Video</button></li>
                    <li>World Is Mine(by ryo) <button id="video2">Official Video</button></li>
                    <li>Ievan Polkka <button id="video3">Official Video</button></li>
                </ul>
                <p>The fan culture exploded and people began to make art, music videos, remixes, fanfics and games
                    related to Vocaloid</p>

                <p>By this time, the vocaloid characters have expanded beyond solely Hatsune Miku to characters such as
                    Kagamine Rin, GUMI and Megurine Luka until eventually Vocaloid has become what it is today</p>

            <h3>Live Performances With Vocaloid</h3> <!--Second Part Of Culture Subtopic-->
            <div>
                <p>With the advancement of technology these days, vocaloid performances have become a common event for
                    fans to experience. These concerts involve 3-dimensional projections of the vocaloid characters,
                    most commonly, Hatsune Miku</p>
                <!--insert image of Hatsune Miku live performance-->
                <p>These performances are also usually accompanied by human bands while the idol, in this case Hatsune
                    Miku, moves, sings, dances and interacts with the audience</p>
                <!--insert image of Hatsune Miku interacting with audience/ bands during live performance-->
            </div>

            <div>
                <p>These vocaloid characters are animated in 3D using MikuMikuDance (MMD) or a custom software where
                    they are projected onto transparent screens during the live performances to create the illusion for
                    the audience that the character is on stage</p>
                <!--insert image?-->
                <p>You may wonder, how do the characters sing if they are only a projection? Well, it is quite simple
                    actually. The Vocaloid's vocals which are pre-programmed are just played in sync with the visuals
                    while a real band or orchestra play the instrumental part of the song, creating the idea that the
                    projection of the Vocaloid is actually singing</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <p>Some examples of vocaloid live performances that have taken place are:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Magical Mirai</li>
                    <li>Miku Expo</li>
                    <li>Project DIVA Live</li>
                </ol>

                <p class="msg-box" id="sum-box">Hey! Miku would like to sum two numbers up for you!</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <p>This year, 2025, Miku Expo is coming to Asia and I herding large numbers of fans who are scrambling
                    to pay over $100-$300 to snag an experience</p>

        <h2>Vocaloid Synthesizer Technology</h2>
        <article>
            <h3>How Does It Work?</h3>
            <div>
                <p>To start things off, users install the synthesizer software of their choice (the different kinds of
                    synthesizer software can be found below)</p>
                <p>Given a variety of voicebanks in the software, the standard flow of using these synthesizers to make
                    songs is about typing out lyrics and creating a melody which the vocaloid (depending on the used
                    voicebank) will sing to</p>
                <p>The voicebanks are created based on human recordings, where a voice actor sings basic sounds
                    (phonemes) of different pitches, tones and articulations for a larger variety which are then
                    processed into a voicebank</p>
            </div>
        </article>

        <article>
            <h3>What are the different types of Vocaloid Synthesizers?</h3>
            <div>
                <p>Some of the more commonly known synthesizers are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>VOCALOID</li>
                    <li>UTAU</li>
                    <li>CeVIO AI</li>
                    <li>SynthV (Synthesizer V)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>As much as VOCALOID is the first software where all the other synthesizers originated their base
                    from, VOCALOID is not necessarily the most used software among them</p>
            </div>
            <h3>What is the difference?</h3>
            <div>
                <p>As mentioned previously, VOCALOID is created by Yamaha, however, the other synthesizers are made by
                    other people and managed in different ways, for example, UTAU is a free and community driven
                    synthesizer instead of being mainly managed by the developer of the software</p>
                <p>Other than such a simple difference, a synthesizer like SynthV is said to be more realistic and
                    AI-based as compared to the other synthesizers</p>
                <p>For different reasons other than the ones stated, people used different synthesizers based on their
                    preferences</p>
